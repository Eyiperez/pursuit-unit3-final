# UNIT 3 FINAL: PART I

In this part, you will be given code snippets and asked questions about those snippets. Feel free to run this code in the linked environments to help debug the issues. 

## 👉👉 README CAREFULLY BEFORE CONTINUING! 👈👈

For each problem below, there will be starting code linked in a **REPL.it** snippet. Feel free to play around / debug in that snippet. Once you are happy with your solution, copy/paste your solution to a file named **exactly** what is requested in the problem.

Each problem will require a corresponding **problem_1.js**, **problem_2.js**, etc. To submit Part I, zip up your 4 solution files and upload to canvas. (Problem 4 will need a folder)

## Problem 1

Add the following 2 routes to **[this express server](https://repl.it/@mottaquikarim/AvariciousWelcomeField):

### GET /time
Returns JSON that looks like this:

```
{
  "time": "Wed Jan 23 2019 21:03:06 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)"
}
```

### GET /greet/:name

Returns JSON that looks like this:

```
{
  "greeting": "Hello Mo!"
}
```

(if someone made a GET request to `/greet/Mo`).

Copy and paste your solution from `index.js` in the **REPL** snippet into a file called **problem_1.js**. **THIS IS YOUR SOLLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM**.

## Problem 2

Add `body-parser` middleware (already required) in the appropriate spot in **[this express server](https://repl.it/@mottaquikarim/MealyDarkseagreenEngine)** to ensure POST body content can be adequately sent to the server.

**SUPPORT BOTH FORM-ENCODED AND JSON POST BODYs**

Copy and paste your solution from `index.js` in the **REPL** snippet into a file called **problem_2.js**. **THIS IS YOUR SOLLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM**.

### Resources

To test, you can **cURL**:

```
$ curl -X POST ${YOUR_REPL_URL}/user
```

Be sure to swap the `${YOUR_REPL_URL}` to whatever is on the righthand side of your screen. For the response above, you want to get back a JSON response.

## Problem 3

The `user` routes for **[this express server](https://repl.it/@mottaquikarim/WindingNativeDatamart)** are not working! Implement a fix to ensure this works. Be sure to note the `user.js` file on the snippet above.

Copy and paste your solution from **`user.js`** in the **REPL** snippet into a file called **problem_3.js**. **THIS IS YOUR SOLLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM**.


### Resources

To test, you can **cURL**:

```
$ curl -X POST ${YOUR_REPL_URL}/user
$ curl -X GET ${YOUR_REPL_URL}/user/1
$ curl -X PUT ${YOUR_REPL_URL}/user/1
$ curl -X DELETE ${YOUR_REPL_URL}/user/1
```

Be sure to swap the `${YOUR_REPL_URL}` to whatever is on the righthand side of your screen. For all responses, you *want*: `{"success": true,}`

## Problem 4

Given an authenticator middleware, lock down the routes in **[this express server](https://repl.it/@mottaquikarim/ExcitingOffensiveEllipse)** to ensure they cannot be access publicly.

This problem may require changes to multiple pages - copy and paste the content of the files that you changed into a **folder** called **problem_4**. **THIS IS YOUR SOLLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM**.

### Resources

To test, you can **cURL**:

```
$ curl -X POST ${YOUR_REPL_URL}/user
```
Expect 403

```
$ curl -X POST ${YOUR_REPL_URL}/user -H "Token: test"
```
Expect `{"success": true,}`

```
$ curl -X POST ${YOUR_REPL_URL}/post
```
Expect 403

```
$ curl -X POST ${YOUR_REPL_URL}/post -H "Token: test"
```
Expect `{"success": true,}`

etc
