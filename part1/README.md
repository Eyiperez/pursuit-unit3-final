# UNIT 3 FINAL: PART I

In this part, you will be given code snippets and asked questions about those snippets. Feel free to run this code in the linked environments to help debug the issues. 

## ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ README CAREFULLY BEFORE CONTINUING! ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ

For each problem below, there will be starting code linked in a **REPL.it** snippet. Feel free to play around / debug in that snippet. Once you are happy with your solution, copy/paste your solution to a file named **exactly** what is requested in the problem.

## Problem 1

Add the following 2 routes to **[this express server](https://repl.it/@mottaquikarim/AvariciousWelcomeField):

### GET /time
Returns JSON that looks like this:

```
{
  "time": "Wed Jan 23 2019 21:03:06 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)"
}
```

### GET /greet/:name

Returns JSON that looks like this:

```
{
  "greeting": "Hello Mo!"
}
```

(if someone made a GET request to `/greet/Mo`).

Copy and paste your solution from `index.js` in the **REPL** snippet into a file called **problem_1.js**. **THIS IS YOUR SOLLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM**.

## Problem 2

Add `body-parser` middleware (already required) in the appropriate spot in **[this express server](https://repl.it/@mottaquikarim/MealyDarkseagreenEngine)** to ensure POST body content can be adequately sent to the server.

**SUPPORT BOTH FORM-ENCODED AND JSON POST BODYs**

Copy and paste your solution from `index.js` in the **REPL** snippet into a file called **problem_2.js**. **THIS IS YOUR SOLLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM**.
